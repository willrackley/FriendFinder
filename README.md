# FriendFinder
* This app is a compatibility-based Friend Finder app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## How it Works
* Upon opening the web application the user is shown the homepage where they have the option to 'Get Started'.

* Once the user clicks 'Get Started', they are then shown a survey where they enter their first name, location, age, a link to a photo that they identify with, and ten questions where they can answer with a number from 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree).

* The application then takes the scores from the users survery and compares them to the scores of other entries in the api database. Using a mathematical process, the user is then match with a person from the api database that most resembles the users' survey answers.
